# Tower of Tech

This repository contains tech-related playlists and utilities used to manage them.

## Playlists


    The final (planned, can be changed) state of playlist served by this repository should be like this:
    A playlist name should contain prefix and "tech" suffix.
  

* Speed prefix could be "Adep", "Acc", "Mid", "Fast" and "Sonic".
* Tech suffix would be "Comfy", "Tech", "Hitech", "Anglehell" and "Tempo".


    There are and will be "guest" playlists - f.e. Morgolf's.
  

## Contributing

Do you have a great...

* ...tech playlist and you would love to share it?
* ...idea regarding this project?
* ...advice to move some map to other category?
* ...opinion on something is not actually a tech?

If first 3: DM me on discord or do an issue on this repository

What I need now?

* More people recommending me maps to try out for categorization
* More people who will be doublechecking categorization

## Thanks!
