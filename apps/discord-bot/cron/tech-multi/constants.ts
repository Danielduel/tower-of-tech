## Brief summary

We will kick off the multi with beginner-friendly things.
Then we will transition between 1st and 2nd hour with middle-level stuff.
We will top that all off with maps that most of us prefer to see only via thick layer of twitch magic.

## First time here?

We use a mod called Multiplayer+ which is available for PCVR and standalone Quest users.
