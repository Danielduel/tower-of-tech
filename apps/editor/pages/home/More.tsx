      Hi,
      <br />
      The easiest way to understand this project will be reading this overview
      how it originated and it is closely related with how I've developed as a
      player.
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      I've started playing BeatSaber on 29th May of 2018.
      <br />
      At first I was bottomstream player and complex streams were my favorite.
      <br />
      In the world of linear streams, tech came to me as something very
      refreshing. I was superinspired to learn this new thing (somewhere in
      2019).
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      I've started collecting maps around 2020-2021 to keep those maps that I
      found fun, and those that seemed impossible, but looked extremely cool.
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      Later, I've started passing those maps that I thought will be impossible
      and I was moving them into split categories.
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      Time passed, I became progressively better, so I wanted to compete with
      much better players that weren't specialising in tech (late 2020). This
      has shown me one thing - no matter how well do you understand the flow, if
      somebody is fast and accurate - they can negate most of complexity and
      still get a better score with mistakes than your full combo run.
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      I started to practice slower tech to improve my accuracy, I slowed down,
      I've started to use fast motion only when it was necessary and I've
      started to split maps into playlists like "To fullcombo", "To fullcombo
      95", ...
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      Later, some maps were way too hard to fullcombo, but were great to
      practice tech acc in how gimmicky they were so I've created "AccTech" to
      put there maps that are hard but they have a rich variety of angles to
      practice on.
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      As the theme goes here - after some time even those started to feel easy.
      People who knew me rarely asked me if I can share those playlists that I
      use and each time I had to explain what playlist does what, so I've
      started to split AccTech further into AccHitech to draw the line between
      normal tech and heavy tech... then AccAnglehell, then further...
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      At some point I got a valid critique that the "Acc" doesn't feel "Accable"
      to people. Instead of telling them that it doesn't feel accable because it
      is the point of that playlist (because accable maps landed into To
      fullcombo 95 or 98) to practice on those maps to make them feel accable -
      I've took faster maps from Acc and created Mid, so MidTech, MidHitech.
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      Then I've met few beginners and I really wanted to show them tech, and
      because I've forgot how hard it was few years ago - it was very suprising
      that people had problems with passing those maps. So there, Adept (Adep)
      level has begun.
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      Mid divided into Fast (Fas), then into Sonic. Some Anglehells were very
      special, so I've split them into Tempo and also some Techs were a bit less
      techy, so I've created Comfy and Chill (but Chill got quickly removed
      because it was just too simple).
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      Now, since this naming convention is often confusing, there are talks
      about how to rename it and to rework the gradation.
      <VisualNovelDivider />
      Currently it goes like this:<br />
      Adep, Acc, Mid, Fas, Sonic - are based on burstable swings per second,
      which roughly translated to nps would be...<br />
      <br />
      4nps for Adep<br />
      4-6nps for Acc<br />
      6-8nps for Mid<br />
      8-11nps for Fas<br />
      11+nps for Sonic<br />
      <br />
      Comfy, Tech, Hitech, Anglehell, Tempo are more subjective:<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Comfy</strong>{" "}
      consists mostly of simple/comfy moves, but it has sections which players
      new to tech would find original.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Tech</strong>{" "}
      introduces a lot of sidecuts, returns, bottomstreams, inlines, nonlinear
      jumps, ocassional palmups and rolls that aren't essential to the
      flow.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Hitech</strong>{" "}
      constists of moves that tech had, but it puts them into much longer and
      harder to read combinations.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Anglehell</strong>{" "}
      contantly rotates blocks, it is heavier form of Hitech in the way that you
      have to pay attention to things like an ocassional sidecut inside a
      bottomstream or koji patterns.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Tempo</strong>{" "}
      is not necessarily harder than Anglehell, it is easier to fullcombo if you
      absolutely feel the flow, but one mistake often leads to a quick fail. As
      Anglehell was about making each block hard, Tempo is more about navigating
      in a giant web of possible patterns.
